# AmbientRecordingApp

Quick demo of bi-directional sync with an app and a mock server sharing an API contract.

The app should sync data efficiently and robustly, and needed to be done quickly (in one day). Many shortcuts are made for that reason, but I hope you don't see them right away!

Please see detailed notes on the project and decisions made in `Documentation/`.


### Server Set Up

The mock server is easy to set up and run if you have Node installed locally:

```
cd MockServer
npm i
node server.mjs
```

### Web App Set Up
The web app uses Vite to run locally:

```
# install dependencies
yarn
# run in local development mode
yarn dev
```

### Creating records

The app is capable of creating both Appointment and Recording entities. Additionally, there are some scripts in `MockServer/samples` that make use of the same API through the command line, to test bi-directional sync.
